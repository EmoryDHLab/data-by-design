      This map, second in the sequence of five, presents a syncretic picture of
      the series of encounters between the Beothuk and the British that, from
      Shanawdithit's perspective, culminated in Demasduit's capture and eventual
      death. While the events she depicts span decades, on the map they are
      anchored in place by Red Indian Lake.

      The lower half of the map depicts an encounter between the two groups
      which took place on the south side of the lake in the winter of 1810-11.
      Twenty or so figures appear along the bank of the river. The figures drawn
      in red are Beothuk. Those in black are the members of the British party,
      led by a Scottish naval officer named David Buchan. They are pictured
      after their initial meeting, which was enabled by a Mi'kmaq and an Innu
      guide.

    <p className="pl-4 md:pl0 w-9/12">
      The group of figures set to the right of the larger group—two black
      figures and four red ones—likely stand for the two marines and four
      Beothuk whose (justified) suspicion would result in the murder of the two
      marines the next day. The two red figures oriented in the opposite
      direction may be the two Beothuk who briefly traveled with the British
      back to their camp before they were “told by signals to give chase,” as
      John Paul reports.

      Three triangles stand for the three dwellings, called mamateeks, which

      As for the events themselves, we see several phases of Demasduit's capture
      superimposed. Viewed chronologically, we first see several settlers to the
      east, drawn in black, whom we are told by Peyton, via Cormack, and
      presumably first via Shanawdithit, are some of Peyton's men who have
      hidden themselves in order to surveil the Beothuk camp before their
      morning attack.{" "}

      On the frozen lake is another group of figures, some black and some red.
      The main cluster is composed of six figures in black and one in red,
      presumably Demasduit in the initial moment of capture. To the left of that
      group is a large red figure, likely Nonosabasut depicted in the act of
      defending his wife. Just south of the group is another red figure on the
      ground. While Cormack claims that this figure represents Nonosabasut after
      being shot and killed, Shanawdithit insists that two men were killed that
      day—the second being Nonosabasut's brother, who also came to Demasduit's
      aid.{" "}

      captors—perhaps Peyton himself—leading her away from the home that she
      would never again see alive.{" "}
