    This map, known as “Drawing II,” is second in a sequence of five maps and five additional drawings. It presents a syncretic picture of the series of encounters between the Beothuk and the British that culminated in Demasduit's capture and eventual death. While the events that Shanawdithit depicts span decades, the five maps all center on Beothuk Lake. Time is anchored by place.

    The lower half of the map depicts an earlier encounter between the two groups, which took place on the south side of the lake in the winter of 1810-11. Twenty or so figures appear along the bank of the river. The figures drawn in red are Beothuk. Those in black are the members of the British party, led by a Scottish naval officer named David Buchan. They are pictured after their initial meeting, which was enabled by Mi'kmaq and Innu guides.

    The group of figures set to the right of the larger group—two black figures and four red ones—likely stand for the two marines and four Beothuk whose distrust of the settlers—the result of several prior instances of kidnapping and murder-would result in the preemptive killing of the two marines the next day.<InlineFootnote index={19} /> The two red figures oriented in the opposite direction may be the two Beothuk who briefly traveled with the British back to their camp before they were “told by signals to give chase,” as John Paul reports.<InlineFootnote index={20} />

    Off to the east—the right side of the page—is the Beothuk winter camp. Three triangles stand for the three dwellings, called mamateeks, which housed the group. Thirty-seven marks stand for each of the 37 inhabitants in the winter camp that year.

    The dotted lines on the map correspond to paths taken across the frozen lake during the years that the map depicts. The lines thus connect the series of events depicted, as well as the two sides of the lake.

    On the north side we also see several mamateeks—two drawn in red at the center of the shoreline, and a third drawn in black just off to the east. The black color and rectangular shape indicates that it is covered in the sail that was stolen from Peyton's boat, in the episode described at the outset of this chapter.

    A second set of mamateeks are positioned to the west of the winter camp; these may be the two mamateeks to which the Beothuk fled after the deadly encounter with Buchan's men, but this is not certain. <InlineFootnote index={21} />

    As for Demasduit's capture, we see several phases of the events superimposed. Viewed chronologically, we first see several settlers to the east, drawn in black, whom we can infer from Peyton's narrative, and which Shanawdithit confirms, are some of Peyton's men who have hidden themselves in order to surveil the Beothuk camp before their morning attack.

    In the center of the map we see several groups of red figures pictured along various footpaths; these, we might conclude, are the inhabitants of the winter camp who sought safety in the woods upon being attacked.

    On the frozen lake is another group of figures. The main cluster is composed of six figures in black and one in red, presumably Demasduit in the initial moment of capture. To the left of that group is a large red figure, likely Nonosabasut depicted in the act of defending his wife. Just south of the group is another red figure on the ground. While Cormack claims that this figure represents Nonosabasut after being shot and killed, Shanawdithit insists that two men were killed that day—the second being Nonosabasut’s brother, who also came to Demasduit’s aid. <InlineFootnote index={23} />

    Positioned between this tragic scene and the initial surveillance of the Beothuk camp is a pair of figures, one red and one black, which has been interpreted as Demasduit and one of her captors—perhaps Peyton himself.<InlineFootnote index={24} /> The man is leading her away from the home that she would never again visit alive.
