    The appeal of a timeline is easy to understand. For one, a clear trajectory
    that connects past to present is satisfying; it’s easy to reconcile with how
    we experience the world today. But more subtly, it also authorizes our
    experience of the world. A line is teleological—it implies that we have
    inexorably arrived at this world and only this world, and that there are no
    other possible paths.

    But the reality is that there are many paths that take us from past to
    present. Some paths lead us not to this world, but to worlds never
    realized—or to worlds that require us to “push us beyond the constraints of
    what we think, and are told, is politically possible” in order to usher into
    existence, as sociologist Ruha Benjamin invites us to consider. These
    imagined futures are worlds still waiting to come to be.

    A timeline cannot convey this range of possibilities, but a shuffle
    can—images scattered across a canvas, rather than ordered into a line.
