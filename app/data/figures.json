Behind those are additional columns with the names of Roman, Greek, and biblical rulers. The columns get smaller as they recede into the back of the chart, indicating that those rulers date earlier in time. At the very back of the temple, written on the wall, are the words “The Creation.”\n \nOn the ceiling of the temple are the names of additional sets of historical figures: statesmen, philosophers and discoverers, theologicians, poets and painters, and warriors. They are arranged in keeping with the perspectivized style, such that the more contemporary figures appear larger and towards the front, and more historical figures appear smaller and towards the back. On the floor are channels that correspond to different countries, with relevant events written out. A palette of pastel colors separates each country’s channel from the others. These same colors shade the columns and the ceiling, resulting in an overall impression that is visually and textually dense. At this scale, few individual events can be discerned.",

The final outermost circle is red, similarly thin, and shows that the valuation of all taxable Black-owned property in Georgia in 1899 reached $13,447,423. The circle chart is drawn so that each ring has a protruding triangle or point that reaches inward to the 1870 black center.

    "altText": "A line graph overlaid on a red grid of squares measuring the value of Black-owned property in Georgia from 1870 to 1900. The vertical Y axis tracks monetary value by the million dollar, and the horizontal X axis measures the year, where every grid box along the X axis is one year. The line moves diagonally up to the right with peaks in 1872 and 1883 (measured around 1 million and 5 million dollars respectively) before slight dips in monetary value. Between 1879 and 1883, the value of Black-owned property in Georgia increased from just above one million dollars to nearly five million. Dispersed around the line are descriptions of the political atmosphere of the time. For instance, between 1870 and 1872, Du Bois and his affiliates wrote vertically, parallel to the increase in property value, “Ku-Kluxism,” indicating the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. Above the line around the 2.5 million dollar mark before the subsequent decade of the 1880s, another descriptor reads “Political Unrest.” Below the line between the years 1890 and 1895 and below the two million dollar mark, one descriptor is written vertically that says, “Financial panic,” and another above the latter is written horizontally: “Lynching.” The last description on the grid mirrors the “Political Unrest” label on the other side of the line, which reads: “Disenfranchisement and Proscriptive Laws.”",

The final outermost circle is red, similarly thin, and shows that the valuation of all taxable Black-owned property in Georgia in 1899 reached $13,447,423. The circle chart is drawn so that each ring has a protruding triangle or point that reaches inward to the 1870 black center.

These categories connect to a bar chart that shows the percentage of how much the various classes of Black families spend on each expense. Each expense includes a brief explanatory note or image below it to provide detail about what the percentages refer to. For instance, under “rent,” there is a photograph of a four houses lined up on a street that Du Bois’ team labels a “well-to-do neighborhood.” Similarly, under “clothes,” two portraits of a young Black boy and a Black woman are present. The other three expenses include worded descriptions, like the “other expenses and savings” category, which lists what the team terms “the higher life,” including items like religion, art, amusements, books, and travel. Under each expense description or image, a bar of black, purple, pink, blue, or gray lies to help indicate the percentages of expenses given to each category in the chart. Every income bracket except for the last is paired with the one above it, where those families bringing in $139.10-$249.45 yearly are classified as “poor,” those making $335.86-$433.82 are deemed “fair,” those making $547-$880 are “comfortable,” and finally, the last separate category, those who make $1,125 yearly are “well-to-do.”",

Under the title and its French translation, a key showing five circles of colors indicates increasing population density in the following order: the color yellow represents less than one Black resident per square mile, blue represents between one and four Black inhabitants per square mile, red represents between four and eight residents per square mile, brown represents between eight and fifteen inhabitants per square mile, and the color black indicates between fifteen and twenty-five Black residents per square mile. The majority of the west side of the country is yellow, whereas Texas and several midwestern states are shaded blue. Southeastern states are primarily colored as brown, except for South Carolina and Mississippi, which are black. There are infrequent spots of no coloring at all–right above Texas where Oklahoma and Arkansas meet, as well as off the coast of New York, both of which occur nearby red, yellow, and blue shading rather than brown or black.",

The Black population is represented by a red line, which remains far below the green line representing the white population. Between 1790 and 1890, the difference in population between the two racial groups grew exponentially; both the white and Black populations began in 1790 under the five million mark and rose to more than fifty million people (white) versus merely seven million (Black) by 1890. The chart also depicts various international and national events in a fainter text across the graph, like the “suppression of slave trade” in 1810, “European immigration” placed between 1840 and 1850, and “Emancipation” between 1860 and 1870, in slightly larger lettering than the previous events. The key on the graph, aside from describing how each population corresponds to the two line colors, notes that the small numbers which lie above the two lines indicate the percentage increase per decade of each population.
