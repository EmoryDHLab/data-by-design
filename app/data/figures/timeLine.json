Each column is labeled with the name of an important ruler. US rulers are in the foreground on the left, and European rulers are in the foreground on the right. Behind those are additional columns with the names of Roman, Greek, and biblical rulers. The columns get smaller as they recede into the back of the chart, indicating that those rulers date earlier in time. At the very back of the temple, written on the wall, are the words “The Creation.”\n \nOn the ceiling of the temple are the names of additional sets of historical figures: statesmen, philosophers and discoverers, theologicians, poets and painters, and warriors. They are arranged in keeping with the perspectivized style, such that the more contemporary figures appear larger and towards the front, and more historical figures appear smaller and towards the back. On the floor are channels that correspond to different countries, with relevant events written out. A palette of pastel colors separates each country’s channel from the others. These same colors shade the columns and the ceiling, resulting in an overall impression that is visually and textually dense. At this scale, few individual events can be discerned.",

Between 1879 and 1883, the value of Black-owned property in Georgia increased from just above one million dollars to nearly five million. Dispersed around the line are descriptions of the political atmosphere of the time. For instance, between 1870 and 1872, Du Bois and his affiliates wrote vertically, parallel to the increase in property value, “Ku-Kluxism,” indicating the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. Above the line around the 2.5 million dollar mark before the subsequent decade of the 1880s, another descriptor reads “Political Unrest.” Below the line between the years 1890 and 1895 and below the two million dollar mark, one descriptor is written vertically that says, “Financial panic,” and another above the latter is written horizontally: “Lynching.” The last description on the grid mirrors the “Political Unrest” label on the other side of the line, which reads: “Disenfranchisement and Proscriptive Laws.”",

Each expense includes a brief explanatory note or image below it to provide detail about what the percentages refer to.

The other three expenses include worded descriptions, like the “other expenses and savings” category, which lists what the team terms “the higher life,” including items like religion, art, amusements, books, and travel.

  "altText": "The first chart in the second series presented at the Paris Exposition is dense with text in both English and French to highlight the history and role of Atlanta University students–and the institution itself–in creating the data portraits. The text describes the year the college was founded (1867), the total number of Black students who have attended the university (6,000 at the time of the study), and the total number of graduates from the university (330 students) who have since gone on to work in various fields described in a pie chart. The multicolor pie chart sits in the middle of the page describing employment and other conditions of Black Americans with a key in English to the left and in French to the right of the chart. The largest section of the pie chart is colored in red and records that 58.5 percent of the Black American population works as teachers. The second largest portion of the chart is yellow and shows 28.1 percent of the population is designated as house wives. Decreasing substantially in size to 4.3 percent is the next population of Black American employees who work as ministers, indicated in blue. Other professions and government service follow at 3.8 and 3.2 percent respectively, with other professions colored in green and government service in pink. The smallest portion of Black American employment is under the category of business, which is shaded in light brown and is recorded at 2.1 percent. A small multicolored map of the United States also rests under the title of the piece with a star over Atlanta, GA to indicate the center of the Black population in the country. More text at the bottom of the page states the number of current Black professors, faculty, and students at Atlanta University at the time of the study (20 professors and faculty; 250 students), along with a description of the size of the campus (60 acres) and number of buildings (5), including the library which holds 11,000 volumes. Lastly, the text describes the university’s endowment of $500,000 and the mission of the university, which is “to raise and civilize the songs of the freedmen by training their more capable members in the liberal arts according to the best standards of the day.”",

The chart also depicts various international and national events in a fainter text across the graph, like the “suppression of slave trade” in 1810, “European immigration” placed between 1840 and 1850, and “Emancipation” between 1860 and 1870, in slightly larger lettering than the previous events.

  "altText": "Part grid and part area chart, this colorful graphic shows the marital status of Black men and women in the United States according to their age. The horizontal X axis measures the percentage (from 0 to 100%) of men and women who are single, married, or widowed, and the vertical Y axis measures age. The age increments from bottom to top, are listed as follows: 0 to 15; 15 to 20; 20 to 25; 25 to 30; 30 to 35; 35 to 45; 45 to 55; 55 to 65; and over age 65. Divided vertically in the middle, the left side of the grid tracks Black men’s marital status, and the right side measures Black women’s. Green space, which indicates widowers, occupies each top corner and falls vertically, serving as a border to the majority of the other categories; red space sits next to the green to show who is married; and blue lies in the center and along the bottom next to the red area to depict those who are single. Because of its near symmetry and vibrancy, the graphic looks like an abstract image of a city at sunset, with the central blue area resembling a silhouetted large building, and the red and green areas on either side of the blue depicting the sky.",

  "altText": "A chart that shows the increasing number of Black and Black multiracial residents in the United States from 1800 to 1890. Drawn resembling a steep mountaintop, which begins at 1800 on the right of the page and falls to 1890 at the bottom left, the chart’s downward motion emphasizes how the range and scope of blackness shifted during the nineteenth century. To depict what Du Bois labels as the “amalgamation” of the growing number of Black people in the United States and their shifting phenotypes, the chart sections off three discrete racial categories by hue, which lighten gradually from black to white. The Black population is colored in black and implies that this portion of the population showed no visual trace of interracial coupling. To its right, the color grows slightly lighter as it nears what Du Bois labels as the “mulatto” or multiracial population, which is split between a light brown and a dark yellow color to depict the portion of the Black population that announces a white presence in one’s lineage. The white population section is predominately drawn with the paper’s off-white hue, except for a light yellow gradient where it comes into contact with the multiracial population, to its left. There is no quantitative data associated with the white population. While no percentages or numbers are stated in the slimmer sections tracking the 1800s or 1840s, the chart shows that by 1860 the Black population amounted to 3,542,147 people–90% of all Black people in America–and the multiracial population made up the remaining 10% of the total Black population. In 1890, while both grew in size, the Black population decreased to 85% (6,337,980 people) while the Black multiracial population increased to 15% (1,113,063 people).",
