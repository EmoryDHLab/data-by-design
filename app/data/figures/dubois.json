The four bars begin horizontally and turn downward to connect to their respective percentages, creating a criss-cross pattern. The first bar for the year 1860 measures 99 percent illiteracy in the Black Georgian population, so the horizontal portion of the bar does not extend far into the page. The bar for 1870 measures 92 percent illiteracy, thus the horizontal bar stretches farther than the previous year, but not by much. In 1880, the illiteracy percentage decreased to 81.8 percent, and in 1890, the illiteracy percentage decreased to 67.2 percent, both horizontal bars taking up more space than the previous year(s).

A blue curving bar falls just under the pink to represent 1880’s value of kitchen and household furniture, reaching $498,532. The next curving bar is brown for the year 1885 with a value of Black-owned furniture in Georgia reaching $736,170. Beneath the brown bar is a yellow curving bar for 1890, for which $1,173,624 was assessed to be the value of household and kitchen items owned by Black Georgians. The second bottom-most curving light gray bar shows that the value for Black-owned furniture in 1895 was $1,322,694. The last curving bar is red for the year 1899 and indicates that the value of household and kitchen furniture owned by Black Georgians reached $1,434,975.

The ring surrounding the black circle is brown and shows the valuation of taxable Black-owned property in 1880 was $5,764,293. The next outermost ring is thicker and blue, indicating an increase in taxable property in 1885 to $8,153,390. An even thicker yellow ring surrounds the blue, showing $12,322,003 in 1890. The second outermost ring is smaller and gray and indicates the valuation in 1895 to be $12,941,230. The final outermost circle is red, similarly thin, and shows that the valuation of all taxable Black-owned property in Georgia in 1899 reached $13,447,423. The circle chart is drawn so that each ring has a protruding triangle or point that reaches inward to the 1870 black center. With each overlapping circle, the intrusive triangles become thicker and are overlaid by the other rings’s colors, creating a hypnotic effect as if each circle is being torn back to reveal the black center, emphasized by each triangle’s jagged edges.",

The four bars begin horizontally and turn downward to connect to their respective percentages, creating a criss-cross pattern. The first bar for the year 1860 measures 99 percent illiteracy in the Black Georgian population, so the horizontal portion of the bar does not extend far into the page. The bar for 1870 measures 92 percent illiteracy, thus the horizontal bar stretches farther than the previous year, but not by much. In 1880, the illiteracy percentage decreased to 81.8 percent, and in 1890, the illiteracy percentage decreased to 67.2 percent, both horizontal bars taking up more space than the previous year(s). Lastly, in 1900, the percentage of illiterate Black Georgians decreased once again to 50 percent of the population, the horizontal bar stretching the width of the chart.",

Between 1879 and 1883, the value of Black-owned property in Georgia increased from just above one million dollars to nearly five million. Dispersed around the line are descriptions of the political atmosphere of the time. For instance, between 1870 and 1872, Du Bois and his affiliates wrote vertically, parallel to the increase in property value, “Ku-Kluxism,” indicating the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. Above the line around the 2.5 million dollar mark before the subsequent decade of the 1880s, another descriptor reads “Political Unrest.” Below the line between the years 1890 and 1895 and below the two million dollar mark, one descriptor is written vertically that says, “Financial panic,” and another above the latter is written horizontally: “Lynching.” The last description on the grid mirrors the “Political Unrest” label on the other side of the line, which reads: “Disenfranchisement and Proscriptive Laws.”",

    "altText": "A mixed media chart that indicates how Black Georgian families from various class backgrounds make and spend their money. The visualization combines inked typography, photograph, colored charts, mechanical type, and a gold-plated seal of one American dollar. Organized vertically into categories based on family income, the subcategories along the horizontal X axis top the chart to list the cost of rent, food, clothing, taxes, and other expenses and savings. These categories connect to a bar chart that shows the percentage of how much the various classes of Black families spend on each expense. Each expense includes a brief explanatory note or image below it to provide detail about what the percentages refer to. For instance, under “rent,” there is a photograph of a four houses lined up on a street that Du Bois’ team labels a “well-to-do neighborhood.” Similarly, under “clothes,” two portraits of a young Black boy and a Black woman are present. The other three expenses include worded descriptions, like the “other expenses and savings” category, which lists what the team terms “the higher life,” including items like religion, art, amusements, books, and travel. Under each expense description or image, a bar of black, purple, pink, blue, or gray lies to help indicate the percentages of expenses given to each category in the chart. Every income bracket except for the last is paired with the one above it, where those families bringing in $139.10-$249.45 yearly are classified as “poor,” those making $335.86-$433.82 are deemed “fair,” those making $547-$880 are “comfortable,” and finally, the last separate category, those who make $1,125 yearly are “well-to-do.”",

The multicolor pie chart sits in the middle of the page describing employment and other conditions of Black Americans with a key in English to the left and in French to the right of the chart. The largest section of the pie chart is colored in red and records that 58.5 percent of the Black American population works as teachers. The second largest portion of the chart is yellow and shows 28.1 percent of the population is designated as house wives. Decreasing substantially in size to 4.3 percent is the next population of Black American employees who work as ministers, indicated in blue. Other professions and government service follow at 3.8 and 3.2 percent respectively, with other professions colored in green and government service in pink. The smallest portion of Black American employment is under the category of business, which is shaded in light brown and is recorded at 2.1 percent. A small multicolored map of the United States also rests under the title of the piece with a star over Atlanta, GA to indicate the center of the Black population in the country. More text at the bottom of the page states the number of current Black professors, faculty, and students at Atlanta University at the time of the study (20 professors and faculty; 250 students), along with a description of the size of the campus (60 acres) and number of buildings (5), including the library which holds 11,000 volumes. Lastly, the text describes the university’s endowment of $500,000 and the mission of the university, which is “to raise and civilize the songs of the freedmen by training their more capable members in the liberal arts according to the best standards of the day.”",

To depict the “amalgamation” of the growing number of Black people in the United States and their shifting phenotypes, the chart sections off three discrete racial categories by hue, which lighten gradually from black to white. The “Negro” population section of the chart is given a black hue that grows slightly lighter as it nears the “mulatto” population, which is split between a light brown and a dark yellow color. The white population section is predominately drawn with the paper’s off-white hue, except for a light yellow gradient where it comes into contact with the \"mulatto\" population. There is no quantitative data associated with the white population.",
