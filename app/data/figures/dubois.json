The horizontal X axis measures the percentage (from 0 to 100%) of men and women who are single, married, or widowed, and the vertical Y axis measures age. The age increments from bottom to top, are listed as follows: 0 to 15; 15 to 20; 20 to 25; 25 to 30; 30 to 35; 35 to 45; 45 to 55; 55 to 65; and over age 65. Divided vertically in the middle, the left side of the grid tracks Black men’s marital status, and the right side measures Black women’s. Green space, which indicates widowers, occupies each top corner and falls vertically, serving as a border to the majority of the other categories; red space sits next to the green to show who is married; and blue lies in the center and along the bottom next to the red area to depict those who are single. Because of its near symmetry and vibrancy, the graphic looks like an abstract image of a city at sunset, with the central blue area resembling a silhouetted large building, and the red and green areas on either side of the blue depicting the sky.",

The multicolor pie chart sits in the middle of the page describing employment and other conditions of Black Americans with a key in English to the left and in French to the right of the chart. The largest section of the pie chart is colored in red and records that 58.5 percent of the Black American population works as teachers. The second largest portion of the chart is yellow and shows 28.1 percent of the population is designated as house wives. Decreasing substantially in size to 4.3 percent is the next population of Black American employees who work as ministers, indicated in blue. Other professions and government service follow at 3.8 and 3.2 percent respectively, with other professions colored in green and government service in pink. The smallest portion of Black American employment is under the category of business, which is shaded in light brown and is recorded at 2.1 percent. A small multicolored map of the United States also rests under the title of the piece with a star over Atlanta, GA to indicate the center of the Black population in the country. More text at the bottom of the page states the number of current Black professors, faculty, and students at Atlanta University at the time of the study (20 professors and faculty; 250 students), along with a description of the size of the campus (60 acres) and number of buildings (5), including the library which holds 11,000 volumes. Lastly, the text describes the university’s endowment of $500,000 and the mission of the university, which is “to raise and civilize the songs of the freedmen by training their more capable members in the liberal arts according to the best standards of the day.”",

Above the line around the 2.5 million dollar mark before the subsequent decade of the 1880s, another descriptor reads “Political Unrest.” Below the line between the years 1890 and 1895 and below the two million dollar mark, one descriptor is written vertically that says, “Financial panic,” and another above the latter is written horizontally: “Lynching.” The last description on the grid mirrors the “Political Unrest” label on the other side of the line, which reads: “Disenfranchisement and Proscriptive Laws.”",

The visualization combines inked typography, photograph, colored charts, mechanical type, and a gold-plated seal of one American dollar. Organized vertically into categories based on family income, the subcategories along the horizontal X axis top the chart to list the cost of rent, food, clothing, taxes, and other expenses and savings. These categories connect to a bar chart that shows the percentage of how much the various classes of Black families spend on each expense. Each expense includes a brief explanatory note or image below it to provide detail about what the percentages refer to. For instance, under “rent,” there is a photograph of a four houses lined up on a street that Du Bois’ team labels a “well-to-do neighborhood.” Similarly, under “clothes,” two portraits of a young Black boy and a Black woman are present. The other three expenses include worded descriptions, like the “other expenses and savings” category, which lists what the team terms “the higher life,” including items like religion, art, amusements, books, and travel. Under each expense description or image, a bar of black, purple, pink, blue, or gray lies to help indicate the percentages of expenses given to each category in the chart. Every income bracket except for the last is paired with the one above it, where those families bringing in $139.10-$249.45 yearly are classified as “poor,” those making $335.86-$433.82 are deemed “fair,” those making $547-$880 are “comfortable,” and finally, the last separate category, those who make $1,125 yearly are “well-to-do.”",

The bar located in the bottom left corner of the page shows the percentage of those enslaved and freed in 1860 and is divided into a small top section colored in green and a large section on the bottom colored in black. Bold black text within the green component of the bar indicates that 11% of the Black population was categorized as “free laborers,” while bold red text in the black portion indicates that 89% were “slaves.” The second bar, located on the right side of the page, shows the status of Black folk after Emancipation in 1890 and is divided into a small red section at the top and a larger green section that colors in the remainder of the bar. The red portion of the bar details, in black lettering, that 19% of the Black population belonged to a “peasant proprietor” class, or did not own land, while 81% of Black folk, detailed in black lettering in the green section, were tenants. The bar for 1890 is connected to the first 1860 bar by several faded, dotted lines which extend outward from one point along the right edge of the green section of the first bar to many points along the left edge of the green section of the second. The green coloring connects the two bars to indicate the amount of land-owning, free Black men and women exploded within just thirty years, or in one generation. Above the first bar and next to the second, a caption reads: “In 1890 nearly one fifth of them owned their own homes and farms. This advance was accomplished entirely without state aid, and in the face of proscriptive laws,” with a French translation of the sentences below the English text.",

Drawn resembling a steep mountaintop, which begins at 1800 on the right of the page and falls to 1890 at the bottom left, the chart’s downward motion emphasizes how the range and scope of blackness shifted during the nineteenth century. To depict what Du Bois labels as the “amalgamation” of the growing number of Black people in the United States and their shifting phenotypes, the chart sections off three discrete racial categories by hue, which lighten gradually from black to white. The Black population is colored in black and implies that this portion of the population showed no visual trace of interracial coupling. To its right, the color grows slightly lighter as it nears what Du Bois labels as the “mulatto” or multiracial population, which is split between a light brown and a dark yellow color to depict the portion of the Black population that announces a white presence in one’s lineage. The white population section is predominately drawn with the paper’s off-white hue, except for a light yellow gradient where it comes into contact with the multiracial population, to its left. There is no quantitative data associated with the white population. While no percentages or numbers are stated in the slimmer sections tracking the 1800s or 1840s, the chart shows that by 1860 the Black population amounted to 3,542,147 people–90% of all Black people in America–and the multiracial population made up the remaining 10% of the total Black population. In 1890, while both grew in size, the Black population decreased to 85% (6,337,980 people) while the Black multiracial population increased to 15% (1,113,063 people).",

The bottom triangle is black and depicts the total black-owned property value of all three states in both dollar amount and francs: $34,893,684, or 180,796,290 francs. Because the vertical length of the rectangle graphic is larger than the horizontal width, each rectangle is not proportional to its corresponding property value in relation to the others. For instance, North Carolina and Georgia point towards each other as the triangles on the left and right of the rectangle, but their totals have a difference of over 4 million dollars, even though their triangle dimensions are equal. The same goes for Virginia and the total amount of all three states combined, where Virginia’s brown triangle and the black triangle showing the total of the three point towards each other and have the same dimensions, but have a difference of over 20 million dollars in the black-owned property values they depict.",
