Subdivided by street names, the Black population in this region is categorized by a color which corresponds to social condition. Red, green, blue, and black rectangles are drawn within building outlines that run along the streets of the ward. Red describes the middle and upper classes, green represents the “fair to comfortable” working class, blue describes the “poor” lower class, black represents the “vicious and criminal classes,” and the remaining white spaces, which occupy much of the map, indicate white residences, stories, public buildings, “etc..” ",

To depict the “amalgamation” of the growing number of Black people in the United States and their shifting phenotypes, the chart sections off three discrete racial categories by hue, which lighten gradually from black to white. The “Negro” population section of the chart is given a black hue that grows slightly lighter as it nears the “mulatto” population, which is split between a light brown and a dark yellow color. The white population section is predominately drawn with the paper’s off-white hue, except for a light yellow gradient where it comes into contact with the \"mulatto\" population. There is no quantitative data associated with the white population. ",
