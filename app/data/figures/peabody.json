They are arranged in keeping with the perspectivized style, such that the more contemporary figures appear larger and towards the front, and more historical figures appear smaller and towards the back. On the floor are channels that correspond to different countries, with relevant events written out. A palette of pastel colors separates each country’s channel from the others.
