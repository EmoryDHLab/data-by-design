Behind those are additional columns with the names of Roman, Greek, and biblical rulers. The columns get smaller as they recede into the back of the chart, indicating that those rulers date earlier in time. At the very back of the temple, written on the wall, are the words “The Creation.”\n \nOn the ceiling of the temple are the names of additional sets of historical figures: statesmen, philosophers and discoverers, theologicians, poets and painters, and warriors. They are arranged in keeping with the perspectivized style, such that the more contemporary figures appear larger and towards the front, and more historical figures appear smaller and towards the back. On the floor are channels that correspond to different countries, with relevant events written out. A palette of pastel colors separates each country’s channel from the others. These same colors shade the columns and the ceiling, resulting in an overall impression that is visually and textually dense. At this scale, few individual events can be discerned.",

In the first, a hand holds open top layer of the touch interface, revealing what is below: a layer that consists of horizontal strips of copper tape, a layer that consists of vertical strips of copper tape, and between them, a foam grid that serves as a spacer.
