The two lines briefly invert again around the 1775 year mark as exports take a dip to one million, but soon the amount of exports becomes greater than imports, reaching 1.8 million in 1746, and imports plunges from 1.8 million to 200,000 and stays there for the remaining years measured.

Russia’s circle, colored in green, contains within it a smaller pink circle to depict the territories of the empire in the European continent (green) and the Asian continent (pink), where the empire controlled in total 4,720,000 square miles of land after the Treaty of Luneville and the division of Poland. The next circle, showing the Turkish territories, is divided into three slices of pink, green, and yellow, which depict the territories the empire controlled in Europe, Asia, and Africa (respectively), totalling to 700,000 square miles. The next two circles are Sweden, colored in green, and territories the map calls “Emperor’s Possessions” or “Dominions,” colored in pink, which amount to 209,000 and 204,000 square miles, respectively. France is next, with a pink outer circle and green inner circle to show the different continents (Asian and European, same as above) in which the empire has territories, which in total square miles comes to 182,000. Denmark (pink), Germany (pink, yellow, and green, like the Turkish empire), and Spain (green) follow, controlling 170,000, 168,000, and 148,000 square miles, respectively. Great Britain (green), Prussia (pink), countries in the power of the French (green), and Portugal (green) remain, with total square miles in each empire’s control being 105,000, 90,000, 80,000, and 27,000, respectively.
