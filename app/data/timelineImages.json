This chart shows the significant events of the sixteenth century. The chart is a 10 by 10 grid, for a total of 100 squares, each representing one year from of the century. The chart is read from left to right and from top to bottom such that the year 1501 corresponds to the top left square and 1600 corresponds to the bottom right square. Each square is further divided into nine smaller squares, the position of which represents a specific type of event, according to the following key: \n \nTop left: Battles, Sieges, Beginning of War\nTop center: Conquests, Annexations, Unions\nTop right: Losses and Disasters\nMiddle left: Falls of States\nMiddle center: Foundations of States and Revolutions\nMiddle right: Treaties and Sundries\nBottom left: Births\nBottom center: Deeds\nBottom right: Deaths, of remarkable\nindividuals\n \nAn event is indicated by shading the\nappropriate sub-square in the appropriate year. The color of the shading\nindicates the country that is involved. In the chart of the sixteenth century, the\nchart is mostly unshaded, with only one or two events per row (decade). The\nmost prominent set of events occurs in 1565, in which multiple sub-squares are\nshaded. There is no key to the colors included in this image.  \n"

Behind those are additional columns with the names of Roman, Greek, and biblical rulers. The columns get smaller as they recede into the back of the chart, indicating that those rulers date earlier in time. At the very back of the temple, written on the wall, are the words “The Creation.”\n \nOn the ceiling of the temple are the names of additional sets of historical figures: statesmen, philosophers and discoverers, theologicians, poets and painters, and warriors. They are arranged in keeping with the perspectivized style, such that the more contemporary figures appear larger and towards the front, and more historical figures appear smaller and towards the back. On the floor are channels that correspond to different countries, with relevant events written out. A palette of pastel colors separates each country’s channel from the others. These same colors shade the columns and the ceiling, resulting in an overall impression that is visually and textually dense. At this scale, few individual events can be discerned.  \n"
