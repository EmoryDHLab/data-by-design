      The impact of this devastation continues into the present, as contemporary Indigenous scholars such as Mishauna Goeman (Seneca) and Max Liboiron (Métis/Mechif) remind us, profoundly disordering social structures and relationships (Goeman), as well as relations with land and resources (Libioron). As Liboiron, citing Glen Sean Coulthard (Yellowknives Dene) explains, “colonialism is a way to describe relationships characterized by conquest and genocide that grant colonialists and settlers ‘ongoing state access to land and resources that contradictorily provide the material and spiritual sustenance of Indigenous societies on the one hand, and the foundation of colonial state-formation, settlement, and capitalist development on the other.”

    The art historian Cheryl Finley, in her landmark study of this image, Committed to Memory: The Art of the Slave Ship Icon, makes clear that it’s important to identify which version Equiano saw. In particular, this was a print accompanied 4-page pamphlet. Later, the Plymouth Committee printed them together as a broadside. Finley also powerfully considers the impact of this request from Equiano’s perspective: “One can picture how [Equiano’s] eyes might have followed the contours of the darkly shaded figures, counting each one, possibly imagining the face of someone he once knew. Fine black lines representing the wall that divided groups of figures by age and sex might have caused him to pause and think about which space he had occupied or the people who had lived and died next to him. The combination of rows and rows of black figures separated and surrounded by fine black lines schematically mapped the space of the hold, marking a route to untold horror” ##.

    Explain connection to Hurston, Ligon, “Against a sharp white background,” and Senchyne/Fielder book. Bernier also lends her support to this interpretation: “Working not to humanize but to propagandize black subjects bought and sold into slavery, the iconographic emphasis across these broadsides betrays a white British commitment to exposing slavery’s atrocities by imagining black women, men, and children not as individualized subjects but as unindividualized objects defined solely by their incarceration on board a slave ship” (998).

    In fact, Otto and Marie Neurath, the inventors of the ISOTYPE icon system, incorporated their isotype icons into a reproduction of the diagram in their pamphlet on the history of global trade. They also held a ca. 1800 version of the diagram, created by the German printmaker Jacob Xaver Schmunzer, in their personal archive. It is possible to make an argument their icons, like those on the slave ship, were intended to serve as abstract representations of “observed particulars”—in their case, of the population of the world. What’s more, they similarly sought to enlist their icons in a political cause. [ADD IN IMAGE HERE]

    Clarkson’s motivation for these design choices is, admittedly, difficult to discern. Why leave the women unbound when evidence points to the fact that they were also “known to organize, lead, and assist with rebellions aboard slave ships,” Finley wonders (59). Is the exaggerated sexuality of the women figures a comment, on the part of Clarkson, about the “objectified status of the black female body and the history of rape and sexual abuse to which black female slaves were subjected by their white male captors,” or because of his own racist perceptions about the sexuality of Black women, Finley further enquires (59). We may never be able to answer these questions with any degree of certainty, but their possible answers expand our understanding of the chart nonetheless. More specifically, they underscore the perspective inhabited by the chart, and point to the additional perspectives we must consider if we are to achieve a more complete picture of the actual subject at hand.

    Here, Ian Baucom argues, Clarkson mobilizes a central tenet of the Scottish Enlightenment, which held that meaning was created first by verifiable evidence and then through a responsibly used imagination. In this case, Clarkson enlists the “facts” of the slave trade in the interest of engaging the “otherwise disinterested spectator in the sufferings of an actually unseen other” (Baucom ##). But for this transformation to take place, the viewer would be required to enlist their own imagination in imagining the suffering of others.

    The viewers intended to be affected by this image were white abolitionists, and the response that was intended was one of imaginative, sympathetic response. Clarkson himself frames the value of the image in these terms, recalling how “No one saw it but he was impressed. It spoke to him in a language, which was at once intelligible and irresistible. It brought forth tears of sympathy in behalf of the sufferers, and it fixed their sufferings in his heart” (##).

But for this transformation to take place, the viewer would be required to enlist their own imagination in imagining the suffering of others.

    In adapting this particular style of image, the hydrographic map, to the abolitionist movement, Clarkson also imposes the colonial valences of mapping—and mapping waterways in particular—onto the abolitionist movement.  Here, however, it is not the discovery of new trade routes, but the discovery of the horrors of slavery, that the image renders visible; and these horrors were, of course, already viscerally known to those who experienced the trade’s direct effects.

In related work, Wainer traces a direct line from Playfair to Jacques Bertin, author of The Semiology of Graphics, the most significant study of visualization of the twentieth century (Bertin 1983, vii). Bertin himself selects an 1805 chart of Playfair’s as one of only two historical images he reproduces in his foundational text. Michael Friendly, in “The Golden Age of Statistical Graphics,” similarly canonizes Playfair (Statistical Science 23.4 (2008): 502-535); and more recently, Sandra Rendgen, centers Playfair in her History of Information Graphics (Koln, Germany: Taschen, 2019).

    Responsible for numerous failed money-making schemes throughout his life,
    Playfair, in 1816, attempted blackmail. Claiming ownership of a set of
    papers that would cast doubt on the lineage of the twin inheritors of the
    Douglas estate—a seven-year debate, known as the Douglas Cause, that earned
    dubious distinction as the longest and most expensive legal battle in
    Scottish history—Playfair attempted to extort funds from Lord Douglas
    himself, one of the wealthiest men in Scotland. For more on this episode in

    Wainer and Spence push this analysis even further, finding “minor, but careless, arithmetical errors in the tables” which “throws into doubt the accurracy of the remaining numbers in these and the other tables,” as well as discrepancies in the visual “rendering of the raw data,” especially in the third edition. Their analysis focuses on the charts involving the West Indies and Jersey, Guernsey, and Alderney, but they arrive at a conclusion about the charts overall, which is that “some of the curves that connect the datapoints seem to have derived their shapes from Playfair’s opinion of how the itnervening data should look” (19, 18).

    While it exceeds the scope of this chapter, it is worth noting that another one of Shanawdithit’s maps—fourth in the sequence—contains annotations so “copious,” as Howley describes them, that they threaten to overrun the map itself (243). These annotations are primarily numerical, and as such, have their own history—regrettably, another history of violence. From the time of first contact, colonists consistently sought to collect data about the Indigenous populations they encountered as a means of political and psychological control. As these populations succumbed to effects of settler colonialism, including but not limited to the starvation and disease that afflicted the Beothuk, these numbers were wielded as weapons, proof of the inevitable decline of Indigenous populations. These biopolitical overtones are the source of the continued suspicion of data and data collection by Indigenous peoples and groups. That this type of data collection is documented on the map itself underscores how—as we’ve seen again and again—data collection, data visualization, and the larger colonial project are fundamentally intertwined.

The production of scale is often used to understand the ways in which vaputal moves or Western and settler formations of territory, or territories’ relationship to the larger global political economy. Indigenous community scales are instantiated in myriad ways. It can be useful for communities to understand political and economic geographies in order to advance liberatory claims” (42).

    Geographer Emilie Cameron highlights how for the Inuit peoples in Canada’s central Arctic, the vast Northern geography is ‘ordered by stories – stories that make legible the connections between particular people, places, and ideas.’ Far from ambiguous narrations of Inuit peoples’ experience within the North, Cameron, following the work of John Law, asserts that stories must be thought of as ‘material ordering practices’ – that is, not as ‘something separate from, nor merely representative of, the world around us’; rather stories are themselves material and intimately bound up with ‘the materials in which they are carried’ (377)

    While it exceeds the scope of this essay, it is worth noting the particular
    appeal of Bem's Polish identity. Peabody had a particular interest in the
    ideas coming out of central and eastern Europe as a result of her ongoing
    engagement in theories of language. She had sustained correspondence with
    the Hungarian philologist Charles Kraitsir throughout the 1840s, and he
    traveled to Boston to meet with her in 1847. Peabody went on to support the
    (failed) Hungarian Revolution of 1848, which she viewed as allied with the
    aims of American Independence. Among her central concerns with standard
    accounts of US History was that they were written from the perspective of
    England. She would have likely imputed an anti-colonial stance inherent in
    Bem's system. For more on her relationship with Kraitsir, see Ronda (1999,
    pp. 225-226). For more on her support for the Hungarian Revolution and her
    views on history, see Baym (1991).

    14.1 (1988), pp. 575-599. In this essay, Haraway elaborates her theory of
    situated knowledges via the notion of the "god trick" in data
    visualization—her phrase for the false impression, conveyed by the standard
    "view from above," of being able to see "everything from nowhere" (p. 581).
    The view from above is godlike—that is the "god" part of the concept—but it
    is a "trick" because it only appears to be a view from above, from nowhere
    and no body. As Haraway argues, every visualization is a view from
    somewhere: a view from a particular place, created by a particular person at
    a particular time, and informed by a particular set of social and political
    conditions. In work with Catherine D'Ignazio, I have articulated a general
    approach to countering the god trick, and to acknowledging the situated
    nature of knowledge production in data visualization. See Catherine
    D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein, "Feminist Data Visualization,"{" "}

    while Peabody was the sister-in-law of famed educational innovator and
    advocate Horace Mann, she did not maintain a close relationship with him
    after he married her sister Mary. In fact, there was significant tension
    between Elizabeth and Mary over the intensity of Elizabeth's intellectual
    relationship with Mann. With that said, Mann's death in 1859 seems to have
    reopened the possibility of the sisters' shared interest in theories (and
    practices) of education. For more on this new phase of Peabody's educational
    theories, developed in conversation with her sister, see Ronda pp. 269-317.
