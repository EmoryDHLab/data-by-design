    The medical cause was diphtheria, although Du Bois and his wife always felt
    that the root cause of Burghardt’s death was racism. None of Atlanta’s “two
    or three” Black doctors had been available to make an emergency house call,
    and not a single one of the city’s many white doctors would allow themselves
    to cross racial lines to tend to Burghardt, even with the knowledge of the
    severity of his illness. For more on this incident and Du Bois’s early years

    While it exceeds the scope of this essay, it is worth noting the particular
    appeal of Bem’s Polish identity. Peabody had a particular interest in the
    ideas coming out of central and eastern Europe as a result of her ongoing
    engagement in theories of language. She had sustained correspondence with
    the Hungarian philologist Charles Kraitsir throughout the 1840s, and he
    traveled to Boston to meet with her in 1847. Peabody went on to support the
    (failed) Hungarian Revolution of 1848, which she viewed as allied with the
    aims of American Independence. Among her central concerns with standard
    accounts of US History was that they were written from the perspective of
    England. She would have likely imputed an anti-colonial stance inherent in
    Bem’s system. For more on her relationship with Kraitsir, see Ronda (1999,
    pp. 225-226). For more on her support for the Hungarian Revolution and her
    views on history, see Baym (1991).

    See Donna Haraway, “Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism
    and the Privilege of Partial Perspective,” <cite>Feminist Studies </cite>{" "}
    14.1 (1988), pp. 575-599. In this essay, Haraway elaborates her theory of
    situated knowledges via the notion of the “god trick” in data
    visualization—her phrase for the false impression, conveyed by the standard
    “view from above,” of being able to see “everything from nowhere” (p. 581).
    The view from above is godlike—that is the “god” part of the concept—but it
    is a “trick” because it only appears to be a view from above, from nowhere
    and no body. As Haraway argues, every visualization is a view from
    somewhere: a view from a particular place, created by a particular person at
    a particular time, and informed by a particular set of social and political
    conditions. In work with Catherine D’Ignazio, I have articulated a general
    approach to countering the god trick, and to acknowledging the situated
    nature of knowledge production in data visualization. See Catherine
    D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein, “Feminist Data Visualization,”{" "}

    Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, ​​”The Origin and Growth of the Kindergarten,”{" "}

    while Peabody was the sister-in-law of famed educational innovator and
    advocate Horace Mann, she did not maintain a close relationship with him
    after he married her sister Mary. In fact, there was significant tension
    between Elizabeth and Mary over the intensity of Elizabeth’s intellectual
    relationship with Mann. With that said, Mann’s death in 1859 seems to have
    reopened the possibility of the sisters’ shared interest in theories (and
    practices) of education. For more on this new phase of Peabody’s educational
    theories, developed in conversation with her sister, see Ronda pp. 269-317.

    related work, Wainer traces a direct line from Playfair to Jacques Bertin,
    author of <cite>The Semiology of Graphics,</cite> the most significant study
    of visualization of the twentieth century (Bertin 1983, vii). Bertin himself
    selects an 1805 chart of Playfair’s as one of only two historical images he
    reproduces in his foundational text. Also see Michael Friendly, “The Golden
    Age of Statistical Graphics,” <cite> Statistical Science 23.4 </cite>(2008):

    Responsible for numerous failed money-making schemes throughout his life,
    Playfair, in 1816, attempted blackmail. Claiming ownership of a set of
    papers that would cast doubt on the lineage of the twin inheritors of the
    Douglas estate—a seven-year debate, known as the Douglas Cause, that earned
    dubious distinction as the longest and most expensive legal battle in
    Scottish history—Playfair attempted to extort funds from Lord Douglas
    himself, one of the wealthiest men in Scotland. For more on this episode in
    Playfair’s life, see Wainer and Spence 8-9.

    Wainer and Spence find evidence of similar extrapolation in the chart of
    trade with the Channel Islands. It depicts seven reversals of the balance of
    trade, whereas the data table records only three. See p. 21.
